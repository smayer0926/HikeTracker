#### Epicodus Java Week 3 

#### By Stephanie Mayer && Rich Garrick


## Description

_This application was a two day project at Epicodus. We created the ability for a person to create a journal type place to track their hikes that they have gone on._


## Setup Requirements
* Clone the repo from git hub using:
````
$ git clone https://github.com/smayer0926/HikeTracker.git
````
* Open the project in your favorite editor, this was created in IntelliJ.
* Experiment!


## Specifications
* As a user, I want to be able to create a new hike that can be tracked.
* As a user, I want to be able to update a hike that I have created.
* As a user, I want to be able to delete a hike that I created.

## Future Directions
* I would want to add an API, such as google maps, for the pins to be able to drop on a map. 
* I would also want to add a better UI experience for the user.
